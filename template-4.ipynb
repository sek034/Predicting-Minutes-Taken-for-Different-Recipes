    "__Dependent Variable__: I chose **minutes** as the dependent variable because it is a <u>quantitative continuous</u> variable, which makes it a good target for regression. While the data seemingly only provides integers values for minutes, time is ultimately a continuous variable, which makes it more feasible to predict if converted to a floating value. In a real-world context, restaurants can use this predictive model to plan out feasible menus and individuals will be able to estimate and manage their time in the kitchen, making this predictive analysis useful in time management situations, or even for food and beverage businesses where menu planning might be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Evaluation Metric__: For a regression problem like mine, metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) come to mind. I will be using the **Mean absoute Error**, since this metric is easy to understand and robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Known Information at Time of Prediction__: For predicting calories, the **n_steps** and **n_ingredients** will already be known at the time of prediction, since the ingredients themselves are already available and the number of steps have to occur before the time is calculated, which means that it is feasible to use these features for minute prediction."

    "__Description__: As mentioned, I will be using **n_ingredients** and **n_steps** from the original dataset as initial features for my baseline model. While there are no categorical features so feature encoding will not be necessary here, there is no upper bound for the number of ingredients and number of steps since they are both <i>ordinal discrete</i> variables so some transformation might be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Feature Transformations__: First step of transformation was transforming the columns in a dataset with using *ColumnTransformer* with *FunctionTransformer(np.log)*and *MinMaxScaler()*.\n",
    "We transform data in *n_steps* and *n_ingredients* into log of its data in order to make them to resemble to normal distribution. Then, we normalized the values in two columns with using *MinMaxScaler()* so that they can have the same scale for better prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hyperparameters Used__: \n",
    "We used *GridSearchCV* to predict the ideal hyperparamters for criterion, max_depth of tree, and min_samples_plits.\n",
    "Initially we used hyperparatmers with broad range *(ex.clf__max_depth' : [1, 30, 50, 100, 200])*, and we minimized the range by running the GridSearch for several times. After Several times, we got to conclusion with ```{'clf__criterion': 'absolute_error','clf__max_depth': 10, 'clf__min_samples_split': 20}```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the *GridSearchCV*, we use the ideal parameters to train and test the data with *DecisionTreeRegressor* and fit the data after.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Performance of the model__:\n",
    "As we have have higher train mean absolute error than the test mean absolute error, we can tell that the data is underfitting ```(X_train = 98.6017887834999, X_test = 70.7474696839492)```. We also tried to fit the data with grid search and cross validation, and the gap distance between train data and test data did not get closed up. However, the gap between the train and test data are not too far off, and we can predict that there is no error for traing and testing regression. The possible reason for the slight gap between two might caused by our two features that we used for training and testing the regression are insufficient to explain the data and predict the minute."

First of all, we created a **'steps_length'** column by calculating the length of the text in the **'steps'** column, which can be a proxy for recipe complexity. We assumed that the longer texts describing the steps required for a reicipe, the more detailed or complex preparation processes it may indicate, potentially leading to longer cooking times. \n",

    "---\n",
    "For our fairness analysis, we asked the question, **\"does our final model perform better for recipes that take longer than an hour than it does for recipes that take 50 minutes or less?\"** To test this, we ran a permutation test by shuffling the minutes of **Group X** where recipes take *longer than 50 minutes* to make and **Group Y** where recipes take *50 minutes or less*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose **RMSE** as our evaluation metric as it provides a somewhat clear measure of the average error in our predictions with a regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis**: The model's performance, as measured by RMSE, is the *same* for both Group X and Group Y. Any observed differences in RMSE between the two groups are due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The model's performance, as measured by RMSE, *differs* between Group X and Group Y. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Statistic**: We used the *absolute difference in RMSE* between Group X and Group Y.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Significance Level**: 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the permutation test, we calculated the inital RMSE for each group using the actual data. We then shuffled the `minutes` values between two groups, and the RMSEs are recalculated for these permuted groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Permutation Testing Result**:\n",
    "Our permutation test resulted in a p-value of **0.071**, which is *greater* than our significance level, 0.05. Therefore, we have a strong evidence to ***fail to reject*** the null hypothesis. This ***suggests*** that the model's performance is the same across the two groups: recipes that take longer than an hour and those that take 50 minutes or less. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can not be completely certain when drawing conclusions, therefore these findings merely indicate that our model is **reasonably fair based on the specific criteria and groups tested**; they do not represent a firm conclusion for entire unseen data. \n"
